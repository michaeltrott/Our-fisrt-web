Michael Trott & Oliver Paine Review:

- Interest Of Content : We would give the webpage a rating of 'Very Good',
due to the fact that there is quite a lot of content and images.

- Consistency And Quality Of Visual Presentation : We would give the webpage
a rating of 'Good' due to the fact that there is some consistency with the 3 
webpages, but could have been layed out better. There were some inconsistencies
including not having the nav bar on each page.

- Quality Of Written Presentation : We would give the webpage a rating of
'Sound' due to the fact that the webpage uses the default font and font size
throughout, which could have been made to look better using a different font. 
The links for the webpages were not clear enough, due to their link names.

- Validity Of HTML : We would give the webpage a rating of 'Sound' due to the
fact that they did have a nav bar, header and footer, however there were two
mainpage.html files and also there was a CSS file in their folder, but no
link to it, as they ended up putting the CSS inside the HTML file.

- Evidence Of Colloboration : We would give the webpage a rating of 'Very Good'
due to the fact that they have all committed a reasonable amount each, but there
were a couple of pushes last minute.
